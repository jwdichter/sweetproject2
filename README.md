# sweetproject2
### Author
This project was created by Justin Dichter.  I occassionally do my work in Mr. Torres' classroom, the elusive Room 09.  I also sometimes do my work in my very own dorm room, the magnificant Room 204 in Atkins.  However, if I am really feeling daring, I will do my work in the Library, although that may be too much of a walk.  Nevertheless, the entirety of this project was done on my wonderful Lenovo Laptop that has never crashed and is completely virus-free.
### General Info
This site is know as 'sweetproject2' because there has already been a 'sweetproject1' and there has yet to be a 'sweetproject3' so 'sweetproject2' seems like a reasonable name.  Also, this site was deployed on Thursday, the 22nd of January, 2015.  The URL of the website is http://jwdichter-sweetproject2.gopagoda.io/.
### Thanks
I'd like to show my gratitude to a variety of people and things for aiding me in completing this project.  Before I say any thanks however, I wish to offer my condolences to my fellow classmates, Kelly ("Spring Fling and some crew race are better than Orlando"), Kiara ("117 on the math final"), and Hawley ("wishes he got a 117 on the math final"); their projects will most likely be inferior to mine, so I advise you, Mr. Torres, to go easy on them.  And now, for my thank yous.  In no particular order, I wish to thank Mr. Pillai, BDS, JV Ball, Flik Food (not), Will Baxter (also not), my water bottle, my cashmere sweater, the toilet on the second floor of Atkins, my broken XBox controller, my coffee maker, my couch, the Grill, my Thursday free afternoon, Michael Jordan, Jesus Christ, Bob Marley, 2 Chainz, Halo 3, the 7th Floor Crew, any teacher who has ever cancelled a class so that we can have a sleep-in (that means YOU, Mr. Torres!!!), the side entrance of the Clay Center, my family, my $40 speakers, my Beats by Dre headphones that are falling apart because Will Baxter sat on them, our trip to Orlando in the Spring (which is definitely happening), and finally, people who observe the rules of walking in the hallways i.e. walk to the right, don't go too fast or too slow, look where you're going, and be careful around blind turns.  If you are someone who does not follow these rules, you deserve to be expelled.  And fined.  And expelled for a second time.
